Loved2Folder
=============

As a Last.fm user, I thought it would be awesome to have a tool that would automatically search the loved tracks trough my music library and copy them to a separate folder, so it will be easier to put them on a phone or mp3 player. And since I wanted to learn Python, I'm thinking this is a great way to start.

I'm open to suggestions, especially since I'm using this project as a way to learn Python.

Basically this will parse your last.fm loved tracks list then search trough a music folder for tracks. Someday.
